Today we went on a hike to the top of Mt Victoria. It sounded easy enough,
only about 200m tall but alas the grade was quite steep. The views were reasonably
impressive.

We also went to the planetarium on the other side of the bay. It was also up a
mountain but this time there was a cable car ride to the top. The planetarium show
was okay, nothing fancy.
