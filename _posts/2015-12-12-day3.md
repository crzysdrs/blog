Finally, arrived in Sydney. Got a shower for the first time in 2 days and then proceeded to see the sights. First we went to a bit of a tourist trap aquarium which turned out to be better than I expected. Then we went to Hyde Park and saw St Mary's Cathedral and wandered through the botanical gardens towards Sydney Harbor. Saw the Sydney Opera House which was okay but for some reason didn't live up to expectations. Overall, Sydney doesn't feel quite as different from the US as I thought it would.
