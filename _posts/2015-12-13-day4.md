Today we went to the (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taronga_Zoo)[Taronga Zoo] using
the impressive ferry system that makes it easy to get anywhere in the harbor. The
wholes system is integrated with the metro system too.

Anyways, at the Zoo there was a good selection of animals that probably don't get
as commonly displayed outside of Australia. Of particular note was the really cool
vulture (unpictured) that was part of the bird show.

Spent the rest of the day wandering around Hyde Park again, intending to go to a museum.
We didn't realize the museum was about to close because our perception of time is completely
ruined due to both jet lag and late sun light hours here in "summer".
