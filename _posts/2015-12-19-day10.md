A beach day spent at Trinity Beach. A nice little beach with a history
of being one of the largest staging/training areas for WW2 beach operations.
Not much to see here except a sleepy resort town.

Spent our remaining cash at the hotel casino. I walked away with nothing and
Kevin had a hot streak.
