Today we went on a snorkel tour of Great Barrier Reef. It was all very cool, lots
of sea coral and marine life. It was weird boating out 30 miles or so into the ocean
only to have coral about 6 feet below you. Schools of fish darting around, turtles
and I even spotted a shark (unsubstantiated). Definitely would recommend.
