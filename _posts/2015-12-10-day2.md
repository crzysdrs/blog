As luck would have it, I was the first person at the customer service desk in the morning. I managed to get a ticket to SFO and SYD scheduled for today. I waited on standby all day hoping to avoid the situation I was in yesterday but unfortunately it happened again. My flight to SFO was delayed and I was told I would not make my connecting flight again. I took a gamble and my flight was delayed just enough that I was late but not as much as initially stated. With that bit of luck I was able to make my flight. Off to Sydney (albeit 24 hours late)!
