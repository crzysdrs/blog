The beginning of the trip, optimism running high. That is until my first flight was delayed. Then I was quickly switched flights... to another delayed flight. Which left me stranded in LAX. Several hundred miles away from my luggage in SFO. I managed to get put on a new flight scheduled to leave in about 2 days. So much for getting to see Sydney any time soon.
