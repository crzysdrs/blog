First day in Wellington. Did the standard tourist walk around
town and stopped in at the Wellington Museum. They had a really
cool exibit called
[Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/WhatsOn/exhibitions/Pages/GallipoliTheScaleofOurWar.aspx)
which detailed the New Zealand contribution to WWI. The impressive
part was the 10-12 foot tall human statues that looked extremely real and highly detailed.
It's not apparent from my photos (below) that they are giant.

The other cool exhibit was the [DreamWorks Animation](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/WhatsOn/exhibitions/documents/Dreamworks-events.html). It had tons of models, behind the scenes video and other details of how many of the DreamWorks features were created.
