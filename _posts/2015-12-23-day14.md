Today we went to the other Wellington Museum. This one focused primarily on
the initial history of Wellington and how it has changed from being a simple
port. This museum (while well done) was not nearly as impressive as the other one
but did give us a better overview of Wellington in general.

We also went to the Wellington Civic Center and checked out their [art gallery](http://citygallery.org.nz/).
My takeaway from that is that I clearly don't understand Modern Art.

We also realized that tomorrow is Christmas Eve. It's unclear if there will be anything
open tomorrow to explore.
